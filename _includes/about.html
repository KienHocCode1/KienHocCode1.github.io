          A passionate and dedicated Software development student currently in the 4th semester of Software Development Advanced Diploma at Mohawk College. 
          I have hands on experience in Java, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, PHP and more. I also have knowledge of both front-end and back-end frameworks like ReactJS, NodeJS and Bootstrap5.
          I am interested in problem solving and also in exploring and learning new technologies.

          I'm passionate about programming; it adds excitement to my life, and I can't imagine it without 
          solving problems daily. I love what I do; a problem a day keeps the doctor away. I do not like pushy people.
          If you are nice, I will go out of my way to help you. I like to treat people with respect. I enjoy helping others, 
          and I love learning about new technologies... Story of my life :)
